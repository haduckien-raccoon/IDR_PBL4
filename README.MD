**DESCRIPTION**
The system is currently in the process of refining its rules and pipeline. In the near future, it will be migrated to C/C++ to improve performance and leverage more optimized packet-sniffing mechanisms instead of Scapy. This project serves as a basic demonstration lab for the PBL4 course: Computer Networks and Operating Systems.
